# State-Space Control of Ball on Beam System
## Overview

Welcome to the Ball-on-Beam Control System project! This repository contains MATLAB code and documentation for modeling and controlling a "ball-on-beam" system. The project involves deriving a mathematical model using Lagrange's approach for modeling mechanical systems. The derived model is expressed in the form of nonlinear state equations which is further linearized about the equilibrium point, and various control methods are implemented to balance the ball on the beam.

## Getting Started
- A .pdf file is uploaded where you can have a look at the whole script directly.
- The Demo down below shows the simulation performed on MATLAB/Simulink showing the working of this Project.
- The .mlx and .slx files are available to download and try out for yourself ;)
